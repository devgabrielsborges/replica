**Prompt:**

> I need help writing a **LinkedIn post** that announces **new releases of Handmark**, my open-source project.
>
> The post must be:
>
> * **Professional yet conversational**, like how big tech companies (e.g., Vercel, GitHub, or Stripe) announce new features.
> * **Tailored to tech professionals**, especially developers and contributors interested in open-source tools.
> * Written in **two languages**: first in **English**, then in **Portuguese**.
>
> Post structure:
>
> * **Hook in the first line**: Short, catchy, attention-grabbing — think of it as a headline.
> * **2–3 short paragraphs**: Explain what's new, why it matters, and what people can expect.
> * **Call to action**: Encourage engagement (e.g., check out the release, contribute, star the repo, share feedback).
> * **Tone**: Use an **informative and celebratory** tone that reflects a proud milestone, without sounding robotic or overly formal.
> * **Formatting**: Use proper line breaks, light use of emojis if appropriate (optional), and keep the post easy to skim.
>
> Use the following project files as references for features and improvements:
>
> * (src)[src/],
> * (CHANGELOG)[CHANGELOG.md],
> * (README)[README.md]
>
> For style and voice, follow examples in: (posts)\[.github/samples/linkedin/posts.txt]
>
> The post should feel authentic and human, similar to how high-quality dev tools and platforms announce product updates. Avoid corporate jargon.
>
> **Goal:** Build awareness of the new release, show the project's momentum, and encourage tech engagement.
