# Instructions for Generating INSTALL.md (or SETUP.md)

## Purpose

Provide comprehensive, step-by-step installation and setup instructions for the project, especially if they are too detailed for the main `README.md`. This document is for users who need more guidance than a quick start section.

## Includes

The `INSTALL.md` file should cover:

- **Introduction**:
  - Briefly state what this document covers.
  - Link back to the main `README.md` if appropriate.
- **Prerequisites / Environment Requirements**:
  - **Operating Systems**: List supported OS (e.g., Linux, macOS, Windows) and specific versions if critical.
  - **Software Dependencies**: List all required software, tools, compilers, libraries, and runtimes.
    - Specify versions if particular versions are needed.
    - Provide instructions or links on how to install these dependencies (e.g., `apt-get install ...`, `brew install ...`, download links).
  - **Hardware Requirements**: (If applicable, e.g., for resource-intensive applications).
  - **Network Requirements**: (If applicable, e.g., for applications requiring specific network access).
- **Installation Methods**:
  - Detail different ways to install the project, if applicable (e.g., from source, package manager, binaries).
  - **From Source**:
    - Cloning the repository.
    - Building the project (compilation steps, build commands).
    - Installing the built artifacts.
  - **Using Package Managers**: (e.g., `npm install`, `pip install`, `apt-get install`, AUR)
    - Commands to add repositories if needed.
    - Installation commands.
  - **Using Pre-compiled Binaries**:
    - Links to download binaries.
    - Steps to extract and place them.
    - Setting up PATH environment variable if needed.
  - **Using Docker**: (If a Docker image is provided)
    - Pulling the Docker image.
    - Running the container.
- **Configuration**:
  - Steps to configure the project after installation.
  - Environment variables to set.
  - Configuration files: location, example content, explanation of key settings.
  - Initial setup commands (e.g., database migrations, initializing a service).
- **Verification**:
  - How to verify that the installation was successful (e.g., a command to run, a service to check).
  - Expected output or behavior.
- **Updating the Project**:
  - Instructions on how to update to a newer version.
- **Uninstallation**:
  - Steps to remove the project and its dependencies.
- **Troubleshooting Tips**:
  - Common installation problems and their solutions.
  - Where to find logs.
  - Links to `SUPPORT.md` or community channels for help.

## Tone

- Clear, precise, and easy to follow, even for less experienced users.
- Thorough and detailed.

## Formatting

- Use Markdown.
- Use clear headings, subheadings, numbered lists for steps, and code blocks for commands.
- Use bold text for emphasis on commands or important notes.
- Include screenshots or diagrams if they help clarify complex steps.

## Context

- Refer to the existing `README.md` to avoid unnecessary duplication but ensure this document is self-contained enough for someone focused purely on installation.
- Consider the project's build system (`meson.build` in this case) and existing installation scripts (`install.sh`, `install.bat`, `replica-aur/PKGBUILD`).
