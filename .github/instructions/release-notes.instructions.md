Please help me write high-quality release notes and add them to the CHANGELOG.md file.

Follow best practices for writing release notes, including:

Clear Version Headings: Use semantic versioning (e.g. ## [1.2.0] - 2025-06-08).

Categorized Changes: Organize changes into clear categories such as:

Added: for new features.

Changed: for updates to existing functionality.

Deprecated: for soon-to-be removed features.

Removed: for now-removed features.

Fixed: for bug fixes.

Security: for security-related updates.

Bullet Points: Use concise, informative bullet points.

Chronological Order: Most recent changes should appear at the top.

Consistent Style: Use the same tone and format throughout.

Use the commit history as the basis for creating the release notes, and refer to the project structure found (here)[./] for context when describing updates.

Tone: Professional, developer-friendly, and easy to skim. Use Markdown formatting appropriately.
