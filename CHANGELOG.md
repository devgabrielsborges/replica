- **Modular command structure**: Support for selective template copying with `--readme`, `--release-notes`, and `--post` options

#### Template System
- **AI prompt templates**: Ready-to-use prompt templates for generating README files, release notes, and LinkedIn posts
- **Instruction guidelines**: Comprehensive instruction files for consistent content generation across different document types
- **LinkedIn content generation**: Templates and samples for creating professional LinkedIn posts
- **Release notes automation**: Templates for generating structured release notes following best practices

#### Build and Configuration
- **Meson build system**: Modern build configuration with support for both development and production builds
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Linux-compatible implementation with proper directory structure handling
- **Installation support**: Automated installation of data files and templates to system directories
- **Development-friendly setup**: Debug build configuration for local development workflow

#### Documentation and User Experience
